# BookStoreApp

This developed application consists of two screens. 
On the first screen, all the books and their names and prices are listed. 
The books listed are also distinguished by the visual added next to the best-selling price information. 
On the second screen, all the details of the clicked book are listed. 
In addition, with the chucker library added to the application, the requested APIs and the returned response information can be examined.
